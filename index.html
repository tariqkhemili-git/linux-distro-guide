            Debian is one of the oldest and most influential GNU/Linux
            distributions, known for its stability, security, and strict
            commitment to free software. It provides tens of thousands of
            packages through the APT package manager and serves as the
            foundation for many other distributions, including Ubuntu. Debian is

              <p>
                Arch Linux is a lightweight, rolling-release distribution aimed
                at experienced users who want a highly customizable system. It
                follows the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) philosophy, providing
                a minimal base install and letting you build exactly the system
                you need.

              />
              <p>
                A typical Arch Linux setup is built from the ground up: you
                choose your own desktop environment or window manager, software
                stack, and configuration. This makes Arch ideal for users who
                enjoy learning how Linux works under the hood.

            New to Linux? You may want to start with a more beginner-friendly
            distribution before moving to Arch. If you're already comfortable
            with the terminal and manual configuration, Arch offers unmatched
            flexibility and control.
